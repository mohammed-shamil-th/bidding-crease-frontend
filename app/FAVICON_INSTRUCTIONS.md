# Favicon Setup Instructions

To add the favicon to your website:

1. Save the shared image (the logo with gavel, house, and laurel wreath) as `icon.png`
2. Place the file in the `frontend/app/` directory (same directory as this file)
3. Recommended size: 32x32, 64x64, or 128x128 pixels
4. Format: PNG (preferred) or ICO

Next.js 13+ will automatically detect and use the `icon.png` file in the app directory.

The layout.jsx has been configured to reference `/icon.png` in the metadata.
